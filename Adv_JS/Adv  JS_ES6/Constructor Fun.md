constructor function -
every time use first letter as capital when creating

1. pass all property name as parameter
2. the object of in the function we called method like when we added in object inside function

constructor function in es5 --->

        function Person1(first, last, age) {
            this.firstname = first;
            this.lastname = last;
            this.a = age;
        }

ES 5----> constructor function
ES 6----> constructor function we called as Class
DRY ----> do not repeat the code called dry method (its only therotical term for understand)
